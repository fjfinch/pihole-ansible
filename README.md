# pihole-ansible
Ansible playbook for deploying and configuring a Pi-hole container. Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content.

> Note: You can consider using Pi-hole for the host system -> configure *127.0.0.1* to be the hosts nameserver. This however has one drawback: if the Pi-hole fails, the host does not have a working DNS setup and might prevent you from repairing the Pi-hole installation (if you don't have much networking experience).

## Install & setup
To use this repo, a couple of tools are required:

* git (to clone the repo)
* pipx (to install ansible)
* ansible (to configure the system)

1 - Oneliner to install all above:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git pipx && pipx ensurepath && . ~/.profile && pipx install ansible --include-deps
```

2 - Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fjfinch/pihole-ansible.git
```

3 - Pull the required roles:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```

4 - Execute the playbook:
> Note: add a password first by creating the file `files/env/pihole_secrets.env` with the variable *FTLCONF\_webserver\_api\_password=''*
```bash
ansible-playbook main.yml -K
```

## Extra
Extra blocklists for Pi-hole are optional. If needed, go to the 'Lists' page and add the following URLs:
```bash
https://v.firebog.net/hosts/AdguardDNS.txt
https://v.firebog.net/hosts/Easyprivacy.txt
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/light.txt

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/blacklist/master/adservers.txt

The lists are, in order:

Next is to update gravity. Under the 'Tools' tab, go to the 'Update Gravity' page. Or run `sudo docker exec -it pihole pihole updateGravity` in the CLI.
